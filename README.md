### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Edward Josh C. Hermano
I graduated in December 2022 from San Jose State University with a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering.

I am proficient in Java programming. I have had many courses learning and using Java programming.

I am also proficient in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
I am also well-versed in React, MongoDB, and Node.

I have completed multiple course projects (Schedule.me and Let's Eat) using the MERN stack framework.
Schedule.me was a team scheduling web application where I built a portion of the app's user interface.
Let's Eat was a food-delivery ordering web application where I built plenty of the app's user interface, and the app's database.    
    
In my spare time, I work on my portfolio website (work-in-progress) at https://ewjosh.github.io/.

I also have worked with Python, C/C++, and C#.
