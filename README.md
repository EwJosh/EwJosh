### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Edward Josh C. Hermano
I am a senior student at San Jose State University for a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering.
I am planning to graduate in May of 2023 with a minor in Mathematics.

I am proficient in Java programming. I have had many courses learning and using Java programming.

I have limited experience in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
    I completed a course project (Schedule.me) where I built certain functional UI elements using React.js.
    In my own time, I dabbled to create some HTML websites with JS scripts.

I am currently taking a course on Python.
